# Digital Continuum Energy Model

A recursive simulation of energy flow and regeneration inspired by perpetual systems in digital environments.

## Overview

The **Digital Continuum Energy Model** is an innovative framework that integrates geometric patterns, energy dynamics, and fractal behaviors to emulate a self-sustaining digital energy cycle. Drawing inspiration from particle physics and emergent systems, this simulation demonstrates the intricate balance of energy dissipation, regeneration, and feedback in a closed-loop environment.

## Key Features

- **Cube-Tetrahedron-Fractal Energy Mechanism**
    - Energy originates in a Cube.
    - Agents lose energy as they descend through a Tetrahedron.
    - Depleted agents transition into Fractal Space for regeneration.
    - Recharged agents return to the Cube, completing the perpetual cycle.

- **Energy and Entropy Analytics**
    - Tracks energy flow and entropy across multiple cycles.
    - Key metrics include energy loss, regeneration rates, and emergent clusters.

- **Dynamic 3D Visualizations**
    - Visualize agent trajectories, collapses, and energy recharge patterns in real time.
    - Logs provide detailed insights into system dynamics.

## How It Works

The **Digital Continuum Energy Model** operates as a recursive system:

1. **Cube:**
    - Agents start with uniform energy distribution in a 3D cubic space.
2. **Tetrahedron:**
    - Energy dissipates as agents traverse the tetrahedron structure.
    - Agents collapse if their energy drops below a set threshold.
3. **Fractal Space:**
    - Collapsed agents regenerate energy influenced by fractal geometry.
    - Energy is restored based on fractal dimensions and spatial transformations.
4. **Feedback Loop:**
    - Re-energized agents re-enter the Cube, maintaining the system's continuity.
